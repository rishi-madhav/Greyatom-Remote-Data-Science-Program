### Project Overview

 Student Management System is essentially a curated list of student names, and their marks scored in various subjects. I used the foundational level knowledge of Python learnt in this section,i.e, Lists, Dictionaries and some basic methods such as .remove(), .append(), .split() to clean and prepare the list / dictionary.
